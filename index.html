                </div>
                <p>
                    As I worked on finishing my Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Sacramento, I realized that I excelled at problem-solving and discovering creative approaches, from my upper-division math classes to personal coding projects to this skill has allowed me to tackle complex problems and find innovative solutions. My ability to be a self-starter has led me to opportunities to build my tool kit of coding and communication skills. For example, while building a semantic search engine at ScholarHub, I developed a high-quality program to solve complex contextual meaning problems. This program achieved 90% accuracy on challenging queries. This was accomplished by sharing knowledge quickly and effectively with team members to ensure the best approach.

                        Python is currently my most used language. I have several years of experience writing programs in Python both for school and in the workplace. I have used Python to implement data structures and algorithms, perform machine learning, write scripts, perform data analysis and visualization, and more!

                    <p>
                        C++ has been an invaluable language for me, and I have used it extensively for writing efficient programs and algorithms. I have used a mix of C and C++ in my data structures and algorithms classes, UNIX classes, and operating systems classes in school. I have also used C++ in the workplace to simulate IoT devices.

Review of Sets and Mathematical Notation
A set is a well defined collection of objects. These objects are called elements or members of the set, and
they can be anything, including numbers, letters, people, cities, and even other sets. By convention, sets are
usually denoted by capital letters and can be described or defined by listing its elements and surrounding the
list by curly braces. For example, we can describe the set A to be the set whose members are the first five
prime numbers, or we can explicitly write: A = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. If x is an element of A, then we write x ∈ A.
Similarly, if y is not an element of A, then we write y 6∈ A. Two sets A and B are said to be equal, written as
A = B, if they have the same elements. The order and repetition of elements do not matter, so {red, white,
blue} = {blue, white, red} = {red, white, white, blue}. Sometimes, more complicated sets can be defined
by using a different notation. For example, the set of all rational numbers, denoted by Q, can be written as:
{
a
b
| a,b are integers, b 6= 0}. In English, this is read as “the set of all fractions such that the numerator is an
integer and the denominator is a non-zero integer."
Cardinality
We can also talk about the size of a set, or its cardinality. If A = {1,2,3,4}, then the cardinality of A, denoted
by |A|, is 4. It is possible for the cardinality of a set to be 0. This set is called the empty set, denoted by the
symbol /0. A set can also have an infinite number of elements, such as the set of all integers, prime numbers,
or odd numbers.
Subsets and Proper Subsets
If every element of a set A is also in set B, then we say that A is a subset of B, written A ⊆ B. Equivalently
we can write B ⊇ A, or B is a superset of A. A proper subset is a set A that is strictly contained in B, written
as A ⊂ B, meaning that A excludes at least one element of B. For example, consider the set B = {1,2,3,4,5}.
Then {1,2,3} is both a subset and a proper subset of B, while {1,2,3,4,5} is a subset but not a proper subset
of B. Here are a few basic properties regarding subsets:
• The empty set, denote by {} or /0, is a proper subset of any nonempty set A: {} ⊂ A.
• The empty set is a subset of every set B: {} ⊆ B.
• Every set A is a subset of itself: A ⊆ A.
Intersections and Unions
The intersection of a set A with a set B, written as A∩B, is a set containing all elements which are in both
A and B. Two sets are said to be disjoint if A∩B = /0. The union of a set A with a set B, written as A∪B,
is a set of all elements which are in either A or B or both. For example, if A is the set of all positive even
numbers, and B is the set of all positive odd numbers, then A ∩ B = /0, and A ∪ B = Z
+, or the set of all
positive integers. Here are a few properties of intersections and unions:
• A∪B = B∪A
CS 70, Spring 2017, Note 0 1
• A∪ /0 = A
• A∩B = B∩A
• A∩ /0 = /0
Complements
If A and B are two sets, then the relative complement of A in B, written as B − A or B\A, is the set of
elements in B, but not in A: B\A = {x ∈ B | x 6∈ A}. For example, if B = {1,2,3} and A = {3,4,5}, then
B\A = {1,2}. For another example, if R is the set of real numbers and Q is the set of rational numbers, then
R\Q is the set of irrational numbers. Here are some important properties of complements:
• A\A = /0
• A\/0 = A
• /0\A = /0
Significant Sets
In mathematics, some sets are referred to so commonly that they are denoted by special symbols. Some of
these numerical sets include:
• N denotes the set of all natural numbers: {0,1,2,3,...}.
• Z denotes the set of all integer numbers: {...,−2,−1,0,1,2,...}.
• Q denotes the set of all rational numbers: {
a
b
| a,b ∈ Z, b 6= 0}.
• R denotes the set of all real numbers.
• C denotes the set of all complex numbers.
In addition, the Cartesian product (also called the cross product) of two sets A and B, written as A × B,
is the set of all pairs whose first component is an element of A and whose second component is an element
of B. In set notation, A × B = {(a,b) | a ∈ A,b ∈ B}. For example, if A = {1,2,3} and B = {u, v}, then
A×B = {(1,u),(1, v),(2,u),(2, v),(3,u),(3, v)}. Given a set S, another significant set is the power set of S,
denoted by P(S), is the set of all subsets of S: {T | T ⊆ S}. For example, if S = {1,2,3}, then the power set
of S is: P(S) = {{},{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}. It is interesting to note that, if |S| = k,
then |P(S)| = 2
k
.
Mathematical notation:
Sums and Products:
There is a compact notation for writing sums or products of large numbers of items. For example, to write
1+2+···+n, without having to say dot dot dot, we write it as ∑
n
i=1
i. More generally we can write the sum
f(m) + f(m+1) +···+ f(n) as ∑
n
i=m f(i). Thus, ∑
n
i=5
i
2 = 5
2 +6
2 +···+n
2
.
To write the product f(m)f(m+1)··· f(n), we use the notation ∏
n
i=m f(i). For example, ∏
n
i=1
i = 1 · 2···n.
CS 70, Spring 2017, Note 0 2
Universal and existential quantifiers:
Consider the statement: For all natural numbers n, n
2 +n+41 is prime. Here, n is quantified to any element
of the set N of natural numbers. In notation, we write (∀n ∈ N)(n
2 +n+41 is prime). Here we have used the
universal quantifier ∀ (“for all”). Is the statement true? If you try to substitute small values of n, you will
notice that n
2 +n+41 is indeed prime for those values. But if you think harder, you can find larger values
of n for which it is not prime. Can you find one? So the statement (∀n ∈ N)(n
2 +n+41 is prime) is false.
The existential quantifer ∃ (“there exists”) is used in the following statement: ∃x ∈ Z x < 2 and x2 = 4. The
statement says there is an integer x which is less than 2, but its square is equal to 4. This is a true statement.
We can also write statements using both kinds of quantifiers:
1. ∀x ∈ Z∃y ∈ Z y > x
2. ∃y ∈ Z∀x ∈ Z y > x
The first statement says that, given an integer, we can find a larger one. The second statement says something
very different: that there is a largest integer! The first statement is true, the second is not.
