                </div>
                <p>
                    As I worked on finishing my Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State University, Sacramento, I realized that I excelled at problem-solving and discovering creative approaches, from my upper-division math classes to personal coding projects to this skill has allowed me to tackle complex problems and find innovative solutions. My ability to be a self-starter has led me to opportunities to build my tool kit of coding and communication skills. For example, while building a semantic search engine at ScholarHub, I developed a high-quality program to solve complex contextual meaning problems. This program achieved 90% accuracy on challenging queries. This was accomplished by sharing knowledge quickly and effectively with team members to ensure the best approach.

                            Developed a tower defense game for the Android platform using Object-Oriented Programming and design patterns. This was an entirely original project that included developing the game engine, view, and assets from scratch. I focused on OOP principles, design patterns, and Agile development in this project, resulting in playable version three unique levels.

                            I was the main game developer for a 2D RPG game for PC using Unity. For this project, I designed and implemented the game's architecture and class system. This included writing scripts in C# to implement the combat system, movement, dialog, and more. Resulting in the implementation of core features and first-level design.

                        Python is currently my most used language. I have several years of experience writing programs in Python both for school and in the workplace. I have used Python to implement data structures and algorithms, perform machine learning, write scripts, perform data analysis and visualization, and more!

                    <p>
                        C++ has been an invaluable language for me, and I have used it extensively for writing efficient programs and algorithms. I have used a mix of C and C++ in my data structures and algorithms classes, UNIX classes, and operating systems classes in school. I have also used C++ in the workplace to simulate IoT devices.

I have used it in my data structures and algorithms classes, object-oriented design classes, and general programming classes. I have also created several projects using Java, including some features in my portfolio.

                        Object-oriented design can be challenging, and design patterns can help solve many of these challenges efficiently. I have implemented a host of different patterns, including but not limited to Factory patterns, Builder patterns, Decorator patterns, Observer patterns, etc. Visit my Tower Defense game for an example of how I have implemented these.

                        My ability to learn and adapt quickly is one of my greatest strengths. In my professional experience, I have had to quickly learn new languages, libraries, best practices, etc. By quickly learning these, I have been a valuable member of the teams I have worked with.

                    <p>
                        I have taken several Data Structures and Algorithms classes at differing levels and with several different languages. This has given me a thorough understanding of when and how to implement them. This understanding has further allowed me to develop custom algorithms based on the knowledge that I gain.
